Sample expected run copied and pasted below as output in IDE's console.
Note: In class TestStarBucks two output streams are used:
      - Regular output is sent to standard output stream via System.out.print statements.
      - Output to indicate tests that fail are directed to standard error stream
         via System.err.print statements. Note that most IDEs display this in red.
      Depending on your IDE, console output from System.out.print and System.err.print
      may not show in order of execution.
